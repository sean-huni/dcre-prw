/**
 * The datasource environment variable is a CROSS-REPOSITORY WIRE CONTRACT with AGT, and
 * this test pins THIS side of it.
 *
 * <p><b>It is a ONE-SIDED test and it does not prove the contract holds.</b> AGT injects an
 * environment variable into every stage Job it launches
 * ({@code JobLauncher.DB_URL_ENV = "DCRE_DB_URL"}), routing the VALUE per family. This test
 * asserts only that PRW READS that name. Nothing here can see AGT, so if AGT renames its
 * half tomorrow this test stays green and the service goes back to failing to connect. A
 * green run here means "PRW still reads the agreed name", never "PRW and AGT agree".
 *
 * <p>Reading AGT's source across the repository boundary was considered and rejected: it
 * would break every clean clone and every CI checkout of this repository alone. The durable
 * fix is GENERATION of both sides from one source, which is out of scope today and is
 * recorded as the real remedy rather than implied to be solved by this file.
 *
 * <p>Why it exists at all: PRW read {@code DCRE_PAY_DB_URL}, a name nothing in AGT or
 * dcre-infra ever set. In a pod it fell back to its committed {@code localhost:26257}
 * default, which is the pod itself, and could not reach any database. Both sides were
 * individually green the whole time.
 *
 * <p>Deliberate, minimal deviation from the sibling {@code AgtWireContractTest} in PAI: the
 * offender sweep below strips {@code #} comments before matching. PAI's version matches the
 * bare token in the raw file, which the explanatory comment above the datasource block in
 * PRW, PRG and six other payments services would satisfy as prose. A sweep a comment can
 * trip is a sweep that fires on documentation rather than on configuration.
